what is npm?
- NPM stands for node package manager. 
- It is worlds largest software registry.
- The open-source web project developers use it from the entire world to share and borrow packages. 
- The npm also acts as a command-line utility for the Node.js project for installing packages in the project, dependency management, and even version management.

what is webpack?
- webpack is a javascript module bundler that is commonly used in React to bundle and manage dependencies.
- It takes all your javascript files and other assets in a project such as images, CSS and combine them into a single bundle that can be loaded by the browser.

what is parcel?
- parcel is one of the mostly used webpack.
- It is blazingly fast bundler which allows us the experience of hot module reloading.
- Parcel automatically tracks all of the files, configuration, plugins, and dev dependencies that are involved in your build, and granularly invalidates the cache when something changes. 
- It integrates with algorithms to determine what files have changed in milliseconds, no matter the project size.
- Hot reloading
When you make a change, Parcel automatically updates your code in the browser – no page reload necessary!
- Diagnostics
If you make an error in your code or configuration, Parcel displays beautiful diagnostics in your terminal and in the browser.

Every error includes a syntax highlighted code frame pointing to the exact location where the error occurred, along with hints about how to fix the issue.

Many diagnostics even include a documentation link where you can learn more.
-Reliable caching
Everything Parcel does is cached – transformation, dependency resolution, bundling, optimizing, and everything in between. This means the dev server restarts instantly, and the same code is never built twice
- Parcel optimizes your whole app for production automatically. This includes tree-shaking and minifying your JavaScript, CSS, and HTML, resizing and optimizing images, content hashing, automatic code splitting, and much more.
- Tree shaking
Parcel supports tree-shaking both ES modules and CommonJS out of the box! It statically analyzes the imports and exports of each module, and removes everything that isn't used.
- Code splitting
When multiple parts of your application depend on the same common modules, they are automatically deduplicated into a separate bundle. This allows commonly used dependencies to be loaded in parallel with your application code and cached separately by the browser!


What is parcel-cache?
- In summary, `.parcel-cache` is a directory generated by the Parcel bundler, serving as a cache for storing intermediate build results. It enhances the development workflow by speeding up subsequent builds and optimizing resource usage

what is npx?
- npx is node package execute.
- It allows developers to execute any Javascript Package available on the NPM registry without even installing it.

what is difference between devdependencies and dependencies?
- Dependency is an object that contains the library, which your project requires for production environments and functioning effectively.
- devDependencies are those packages in the package.json file that you need only for project development purposes.

What is HMR in programming?
- Hot Module Replacement (HMR) is a feature that enables real-time updates to modules in a running application without requiring a full page reload.

what is gitignore and what to include in it?
- A .gitignore file is a plain text file that contains a list of all the specified files and folders from the project that Git should ignore and not track.

difference between package.json and package-lock.json
- In summary, the package. json file focuses on project metadata and specifying the desired versions of dependencies, while the package-lock. json file ensures deterministic installations by locking the exact versions of dependencies and sub dependencies.

what is caret and tilde?
- version 1.2.3 stands for 1 major change, 2 minor change and 3 patch release
- ~1.2.3 will update you to all future patch version releases without incrementing the minor version. 1.2.3 to 1.2.9
- ^1.2.3 will update you to all future minor/patch version without incrementing a major.^1.2.3 will use releases from 1.2.3 to <2.0.0.
